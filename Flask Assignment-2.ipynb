    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method is one of the HTTP methods used by the World Wide Web. It is used to request data from a specified resource. When you use a web browser to access a web page, you are typically making a GET request to retrieve the HTML content of that page. Some key points about the GET method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Idempotent: GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times should have the same result. They should not have any side effects on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parameters: Data is appended to the URL in the form of query parameters. For example, in the URL https://example.com/search?query=term, \"query\" is a parameter with the value \"term.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visibility: Since data is passed in the URL, it is visible to users in the browser's address bar. This makes GET suitable for requests where data visibility is not a concern (e.g., retrieving a web page).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Caching: GET requests can be cached by browsers, proxies, and other intermediaries, which can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example GET Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /api/products?id=123\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is often used when uploading a file, submitting a form, or creating a new resource on the server. Some key points about the POST method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-Idempotent: POST requests are not considered idempotent. Submitting the same data multiple times may result in different outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data in Request Body: Unlike GET, data in a POST request is sent in the request body. This makes it suitable for sending larger amounts of data or sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visibility: Since the data is in the request body, it is not visible in the URL, which can be more secure for sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Not Cached: POST requests are typically not cached by browsers, proxies, or other intermediaries. Each request is treated as a unique operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example POST Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "POST /api/products\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Product Name\",\n",

    "In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming request data in a view function. It provides a convenient way to access information about the current HTTP request, such as form data, query parameters, cookies, and more. The request object is an instance of the Request class, and it is part of the Flask web framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for the request object in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Form Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a form on a web page, the form data is sent as part of the request. The request object allows you to access this form data, making it easy to handle user inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Query Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "When users include parameters in the URL (e.g., https://example.com/search?query=Flask), the request object lets you access these query parameters.\n",

    "    query = request.args.get('query')\n",
    "    # Perform search based on the query parameter...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cookies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The request object provides access to cookies sent by the client, allowing you to read or set cookie values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",

    "Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform a redirect to another endpoint or URL. This function is particularly useful when you want to redirect a user to a different page or route in your web application. The main reasons for using redirect() include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Page Navigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing a form submission or any other operation, you might want to redirect the user to a different page. For example, after a successful login, you could redirect the user to their profile page.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Cleaner URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Redirects can be used to provide cleaner and more user-friendly URLs. For example, you might have a route like /category/123/item/456, but you want users to see a cleaner URL like /product/456.\n",

    "3. Handling Form Submissions:\n",
    "\n",

    "In Flask, templates are used to dynamically generate HTML content by combining static HTML with dynamic data. Templates allow you to separate the presentation layer from the application logic, making it easier to manage and maintain your code. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine by default.\n",

    "1. Jinja2 Templating Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask employs the Jinja2 templating engine to render templates. Jinja2 allows you to embed dynamic content within HTML files using template tags, making it easier to inject data into your HTML pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Content:\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are particularly useful when you need to display dynamic content in your web pages. Instead of hardcoding HTML with fixed values, you can use placeholders that get replaced with actual data when the template is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Template Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 supports template inheritance, allowing you to define a base template with the common structure of your pages and then extend or override specific sections in child templates. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the render_template() function in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
